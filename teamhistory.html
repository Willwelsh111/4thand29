    <h2>Baltimore Ravens Legacy</h2>


    <!-- History Content -->
    <div class="description">
        <p>
            The Baltimore Ravens became an official team of the NFL in 1996. Before the Ravens, Baltimore was home
            to the Baltimore Colts from 1953 until the team relocated to Indianapolis in 1984.
        </p>
        <p>
            While in Baltimore, the Colts won three championships in 1958, 1959, and 1968. The Colts departure from
            Baltimore was unlike any other. On March 28, 1984, the Baltimore Colts picked up and left Baltimore in the
            middle of the night, taking all their players and coaches to Indianapolis via the team’s buses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The citizens of Baltimore were extremely disappointed until 1996 when Art Modell took his Cleveland
            Browns from Cleveland to Baltimore, rebranding the team as the Ravens. Since then, the Ravens have won two
            Super
            Bowls — one in 2000 and another in 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2000 Ravens relied strongly on their defense to defeat the New York Giants in the Super Bowl,
            allowing only 7 points with a final score of 34-7. The Ravens then went 12 years before reaching another
            Super
            Bowl in which they defeated the San Francisco 49ers in a much closer battle with a final score of 34-31.

        <h2>Current Info</h2>
        <p>
            In recent years the Baltimore Ravens have been a dominant team in the NFL reaching the AFC
            Championship once and the playoffs for three consecutive years. On the offensive side, Lamar Jackson is the
            starting QB and has been with the Ravens since he was drafted 32nd overall in 2018 from the University of
            Louisville. He is accompanied by five-time Pro Bowler Derrick Henry and recent first round draft pick Zay
            Flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ravens offense led the NFL in offensive efficiency this year and looks to improve during the
            offseason addressing needs at the guard and tackle positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the defensive side of the ball, the Ravens have a lot of talent. Leading the defense is
            three-time Pro Bowler Roquan Smith, acquired via trade with the Chicago Bears in 2022. Other key players
            include
            safety Kyle Hamilton, Marlon Humphrey, and rookie Nate Wiggins. With new defensive coordinator Zachary Orr,
            the
            team looks to improve their defense this offseason by adding depth at cornerback and edge.
